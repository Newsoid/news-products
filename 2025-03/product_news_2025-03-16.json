The jump from an iPhone 6s to the iPhone XR was huge, but I was surprised at how small the performance bump was on the iPhone 13. For the apps that count on a daily basis, speed is often no longer a concern. Most people limit their phone gaming to 2D titles like Candy Crush or Words With Friends. More graphically intense console games are beginning to appear on mobile, such as Resident Evil: Village. AI hasn't inflated smartphone sales so far, and there's been a bit of a backlash against it."
